# Parking-Pricing-vs.-Congestion-Pricing-A-Macroscopic-Analysis-of-their-Impact-on-Traffic
This repository presents our framework for the publication:
Jakob, M., and M. Menendez. 2020. “Parking Pricing vs. Congestion Pricing: A Macroscopic Analysis of their Impact on Traffic”. 
Submitted to Transportmetrica A: Transport Science.

It represents the code required to run simulations for our dynamic macroscopic traffic and parking model focusing on parking and congestion pricing policies.
The code is implemented with the aid of a simple numerical solver such as Matlab.
